It is a multiplayer browser game, whose initial idea is similar to that of ``Slither.io`` (remake of the classic game ``Tetris Snake``, expanding the gameplay to new level of massive games with players from around the world in real time).

In ``Worms At War`` there is no snakes because they are dangerous! Instead, players can crawl through the game with "small" worms - at first - and then become cute but unstoppable giant worms... You must be careful when choosing where to go, as even the smallest can make you lose.
